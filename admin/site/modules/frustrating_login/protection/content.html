                    <p>The solution of the equations is a flow velocity. It is a vector field - to every point in a
                        fluid, at any moment in a
                        time interval, it gives a vector whose direction and magnitude are those of the velocity of the
                        fluid at that point in
                        space and at that moment in time. It is usually studied in three spatial dimensions and one time
                        dimension, although the
                        two (spatial) dimensional case is often useful as a model, and higher-dimensional analogues are
                        of both pure and applied
                        mathematical interest. Once the velocity field is calculated, other quantities of interest such
                        as pressure or
                        temperature may be found using dynamical equations and relations. This is different from what
                        one normally sees in
                        classical mechanics, where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a particle or
                        deflection of a continuum.
                        Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid; however for visualization
                        purposes one can compute
                        various trajectories. In particular, the streamlines of a vector field, interpreted as flow
                        velocity, are the paths
                        along which a massless fluid particle would travel. These paths are the integral curves whose
                        derivative at each point
                        is equal to the vector field, and they can represent visually the behavior of the vector field
                        at a point in time.</p>

                    <p>The Navier–Stokes equations are nonlinear partial differential equations in the general case and
                        so remain in almost
                        every real situation. In some cases, such as one-dimensional flow and Stokes flow (or
                        creeping flow), the
                        equations can be simplified to linear equations. The nonlinearity makes most problems difficult
                        or impossible to solve
                        and is the main contributor to the turbulence that the equations model.

                        The nonlinearity is due to convective acceleration, which is an acceleration associated with the
                        change in velocity over
                        position. Hence, any convective flow, whether turbulent or not, will involve nonlinearity. An
                        example of convective but
                        laminar (nonturbulent) flow would be the passage of a viscous fluid (for example, oil) through a
                        small converging
                        nozzle. Such flows, whether exactly solvable or not, can often be thoroughly studied and
                        understood.</p>

                    <p>Turbulence is the time-dependent chaotic behavior seen in many fluid flows. It is generally
                        believed that it is due to
                        the inertia of the fluid as a whole: the culmination of time-dependent and convective
                        acceleration; hence flows where
                        inertial effects are small tend to be laminar (the Reynolds number quantifies how much the flow
                        is affected by inertia).
                        It is believed, though not known with certainty, that the Navier–Stokes equations describe
                        turbulence properly.

                        The numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult,
                        and due to the
                        significantly different mixing-length scales that are involved in turbulent flow, the stable
                        solution of this requires
                        such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for
                        calculation or direct
                        numerical simulation. Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result
                        in a time-unsteady
                        solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such
                        as the Reynolds-averaged
                        Navier–Stokes equations (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical
                        computational fluid dynamics
                        (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the Spalart–Allmaras, k–ω,
                        k–ε, and SST models,
                        which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. Large eddy
                        simulation (LES) can also
                        be used to solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive—in
                        time and in computer
                        memory—than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger
                        turbulent scales.</p>
